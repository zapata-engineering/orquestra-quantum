    The circuits are split into batches of length `max_batch_size`, except
    possibly the last batch that can be smaller. The number of samples
    for each batch is a maximum number of samples requested for the circuits
    in the chunk. To illustrate, consider the following input:

    - circuits=[c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]
    - n_samples_per_circuit=[n1, n2, n3, n4, n5]

        circuits: a sequence of circuits to be batched. Please note that

          len(circuits), s.t. n_samples_per_circuit[i] is number of
          samples requested for circuits[i].
        max_batch_size: maximum allowable size of batch. Typically it comes
          from specific runner's restrictions.
