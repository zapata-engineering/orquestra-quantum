        Essentially, this method performs the same as `run_and_measure` for
        a single circuit. However, some runners may be able to submit multiple
        circuits at once (thus possibly reducing costs), or run multiple
        circuits in parallel (thus increasing performance). For this reasons,
        usage of run_batch_and_measure is always recommended over
        run_and_measure if one needs to run multiple circuits.

            circuits_batch: sequence of circuits to be run.
            n_samples: minimum number of times each circuit should be run. If
              a single integer N is passed, each circuit will be run at least
              N times. If a sequence of integers is passed, it must be of the
              same length as circuits_batch and i-th number is treated as

        Returns:
            A list of measurements such that i-th object corresponds to i-th

            Similarly as with `run_and_measure` method, clients of circuit
            runners can only assume number of returned samples is greater
